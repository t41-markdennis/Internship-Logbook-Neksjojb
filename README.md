I started my journey as a web developer intern. Sir Ralph assigned me a task to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, which would be a project for all the web developer interns.

To start with, I decided to study the Laravel blade templating engine. After getting a good hold of it, I created an initial design for my CRUD application and pushed it on Github so that I can continue working on it at home.

On this day, I was focused on finishing the main functionality of my CRUD app. I took the time to refine the look of the buttons and transformed them into reusable components. This made the code easier to read and maintain. Additionally, I added alert messages to the app to provide more visual feedback to the user.

I made some minor modifications to the app and added a loading animation and close button to the alerts. These small touches helped to enhance the user experience and make the app feel more polished.

I created new accounts for Github, Postman, and Mailtrap using my work email. I spent some time studying Laravel's Mailable class, which is used to send emails. As a demonstration of my newfound knowledge, I made a simple app using Laravel that sends a test email to my Mailtrap account and pushed it on Github.

Sir Ralph conducted a code review of my CRUD application, "movie-app". After the review, I did some research into Laravel's custom form requests, middleware, and group routing, as these are important features that can help me build better apps.

I focused on learning about Laravel's model eloquent relationships. I started building a new app using Laravel with the Breeze package, which provides a simple, minimalistic starting point for Laravel projects. I created a Post model that has a foreign key constraint with the User model, which is a common pattern in web development. I pushed my unfinished app to Github so that I can continue it  at home.
